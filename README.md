### Event list with search query
#### About
 In this demo project I covered a screen with list of events & once user clicks on any listed event it'll redirect to detail screen & if user is looking for specific event then he/she can search that event.
 In this project I have used opensource api of Seat Geek.

#### External Packages
If we look at the technical side then I have used following pub packages.
- flutter_bloc: Flutter bloc architecture.
- Dio: For Api calling.
- intl: For date formatting type of operations.
- http_mock_adapter (dev dependency): for writing unit test.# rushik_digital_14_task
